What does this code do? The function has 4 arguments and it is compiled by GCC for Linux x64 ABI (i.e., arguments are passed in registers).


<f>:
   0:                   mov    r8,rdi
   3:                   push   rbx
   4:                   mov    rdi,rsi
   7:                   mov    rbx,rdx
   a:                   mov    rsi,r8
   d:                   xor    rdx,rdx

begin:
  10:                   lods   rax,QWORD PTR ds:[rsi]
  12:                   div    rbx
  15:                   stos   QWORD PTR es:[rdi],rax
  17:                   loop   begin
  19:                   pop    rbx
  1a:                   mov    rax,rdx
  1d:                   ret

Simple Explanation:
Divides each element of an array by the value in rbx

Full Explanation:
The function begins by saving the value of the rbx register on the stack, then loading the first element of the input array into the rax register using the lods instruction. It then divides rax by rbx using the div instruction and stores the result in the output array using the stos instruction. The function continues to loop over the input array and perform this division until it reaches the end of the array, indicated by the loop instruction. Finally, the function restores the value of the rbx register from the stack, moves the remainder of the division into the rax register, and returns to the caller using the ret instruction.
