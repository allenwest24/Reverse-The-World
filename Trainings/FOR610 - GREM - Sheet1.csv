Malware ,"- Code that is used to perform malicious actions.
- Less about capabilities and more about the use.
- Typically a person behind the malware.",1,5
Input to REM Staff,"- Verbal reports
- suspicious files
- file system image
- memory image
- network logs
- anomaly observations",1,10
Output from REM Staff,"- What malware does
- How to identify it
- attacker's profile
- IR recommendations
- reports and IOC's
- Malware trends",1,10
Formal Report of Malicious Program,"- Summary of the analysis: key takeaways
- Identifications: file type, name, size, hashes, malware names, current detection capabilities
- Characteristics: capabilities for infecting files, self-preservation, spreading, leaking data, interation with attacker, etc.
- Dependencies: Files and network resources needed, OS versions, custom DLLs, executables, URLs, scripts
- Behavioral and code analysis findings: behavioral, static, and dynamic observations.
Supporting figures: logs, pics, strings, functions
- Incident recommendations: IOCs, eradication steps.",1,11
Virus Total,- Exports: table showing list of functions that were designed to be invoked outside of the DLL,1,14
Hybrid Analysis by Payload Security,"- Free website
- Details on behavior of specimen
- Detonates sample in a sandbox
- Identifies mutants",1,15
Mutant (mutex),"-  serves as a flag that programs can use to serialize access to a
resource.
- These flags are sometimes used by malware to avoid reinfecting the host, acting as infection
markers.",1,15
PassiveTotal,"- Provides historic information about the IP addresses to
which malware resolved over time, network details for those IPs, and indicators that those resources were associated with malicious activities.",1,16
Open Threat Exchange,"- Details about hostnames, mutant values, dropped files, signatures",1,17
Network Traffic to/from malware,"- Beaconing
- C2
- Exfil",1,19
Beaconing,- periodic messages to adversary with info on the state of the program and host,1,19
Command and Control,"- Obtaining instructions from the adversary
regarding actions that the specimen needs to perform, such as upgrade itself or scan a host.",1,19
Exfiltration,"- Sending stolen data, such as keystroke logs, to the adversary.",1,19
Self-Defending,"- Detect virtualization
- Detect debuggers or dissasemblers",1,29
Patching,- Editing parts of the malware that detects virtualization or tools.,1,30
